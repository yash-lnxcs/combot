# Time Series Forecasting 

## Project Goal
We want to forecast metric one year ahead without variable changes

## Approach we Tooked
For this, we use the Recurrent neural network(RNN). It takes 7 days of clicks as an input and predicts the next day's click as output.

In the image below the yellow line is last year's click data and the blue line is the prediction of next year.

# Deep Learning

## Project Goal

Second We want to be able to change the metric/variable of Google Search Consoleâ€™s Performance report to see how it affects the other metrics. For example, if we change the average position from 8.1 to 9 how it will affect all the other metrics one year ahead

## Approach we Tooked
For this task, we developed 4 models for each metric. All models use simple neural networks.
All the model takes three inputs and predicts the other column as output.

I use these 14 rows to test the model (unseen data)

## Task 1 clicks prediction 

This model takes a list as an input [impressions, CTR, Position] and predicts clicks as an output.

![alt text](https://github.com/yashjv8/combot/blob/main/images/image7.png)

The predicted values and actual values have a difference of 200 on average.

## Task 2 impressions prediction  

This model takes a list as an input [clicks, CTR, Position] and impressions clicks as an output.

![alt text](https://github.com/yashjv8/combot/blob/main/images/image3.png)

The predicted values and actual values have a difference of 1000 on average.

## Task 3 CTR prediction

This model takes a list as an input [Clicks, impressions, Position] and predicts CTR as an output.

![alt text](https://github.com/yashjv8/combot/blob/main/images/image8.png)

The predicted values and actual values have a difference of less than 0.01.

## Task 4 position prediction  

This model takes a list as an input [clicks, impressions, CTR] and predicts position as an output.

![alt text](https://github.com/yashjv8/combot/blob/main/images/image2.png)

The predicted values and actual values have a difference of 1 or 2.
